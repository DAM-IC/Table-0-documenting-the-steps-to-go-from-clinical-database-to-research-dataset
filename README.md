# Table 0; documenting the steps to go from clinical database to research dataset
This code was used for a scientific publication where we illustrate why and how researchers should create a table 0, showing how research data was extracted from a clinical source database and how this impacted the data.

## Code availablity
We are currently still cleaning the code to make sure it is well annotated. We will upload the full code in the near future to this repository.
