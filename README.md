# Table 0; documenting the steps to go from clinical database to research dataset
This code was used for a scientific publication where we illustrate why and how researchers should create a table 0, showing how research data was extracted from a clinical source database and how this impacted the data[^1].

## Guide to using the code
This repository contains only one python script which runs from start to finnish. This code is centre-specific and cannot directly be used on other clinical source databases as this will result in undisclosed errors in the resulting datasets. Feel free to use this code to check the methodology of the corresponding study[^1], or use it as inspiration for creating your own table 0. Due to the sensitivity of our patient data(base), some parts of the code have been generalised (e.g., directories and database names), however, functionality is unaltered.

## The data
Because we work with sensitive patient data, we are unfortunately unable to share our data.

## Ethical approval
This study was approved by the Maastricht University Medical Center+ institutional review board (2021-2792).

## Remaining questions
If there are any questions or remarks then you can reach us at DAM-IC@mumc.nl.
